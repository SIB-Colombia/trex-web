It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project. Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance in the Kihansi Gorge since 2003.","id":99,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"Kihansi Gorge Amphibian Species Checklist","unique_names_count":0,"updated_at":"2012-02-09T18:21:12Z","web_site_url":null},{"created_at":"2012-02-09T18:21:12Z","data_hash":null,"data_url":null,"description":"Purpose: record observations about mushrooms, help people identify mushrooms they aren\u2019t familiar with, and expand the community around the scientific exploration of mushrooms (mycology)","id":100,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"Mushroom Observer","unique_names_count":0,"updated_at":"2012-02-09T18:21:13Z","web_site_url":null},{"created_at":"2012-02-09T18:21:14Z","data_hash":null,"data_url":null,"description":"TaxonConcept provides human and machine readable species description documents that help describe the attributes and variation within a species.

Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004.

The introduction in 1994 of a scientifically rigorous approach to determine risks of extinction that is applicable to all species, has become a world standard. In order to produce the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, the IUCN Species Programme working with the IUCN Survival Commission (SSC) and with members of IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost every country in the world, who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge base on the biology and conservation status of species.","id":163,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"IUCN Red List of Threatened Species","unique_names_count":0,"updated_at":"2012-02-09T19:18:22Z","web_site_url":null},{"created_at":"2012-02-09T19:20:46Z","data_hash":null,"data_url":null,"description":"BioLib is an international encyclopedia of plants, fungi and animals.","id":164,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"BioLib.cz","unique_names_count":0,"updated_at":"2012-02-09T19:20:49Z","web_site_url":null},{"created_at":"2012-02-09T19:43:03Z","data_hash":null,"data_url":null,"description":"{}","id":165,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"Tropicos - Missouri Botanical Garden","unique_names_count":0,"updated_at":"2012-02-09T19:43:06Z","web_site_url":null},{"created_at":"2012-02-09T20:05:41Z","data_hash":null,"data_url":null,"description":"NLBIF is the Dutch Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility network.","id":166,"logo_url":null,"name_strings_count":0,"refresh_period_days":14,"title":"nlbif","unique_names_count":0,"updated_at":"2012-02-09T20:05:44Z","web_site_url":null},{"created_at":"2012-02-09T20:36:27Z","data_hash":null,"data_url":null,"description":"The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) is a database of the names and associated basic bibliographical details of seed plants, ferns and lycophytes.
